## Choosing UPenn MCIT Online for My Educational Journey

The decision to enroll in the MCIT Online program was driven by the allure of UPenn's prestige and the expansive network it offers. The program's vibrant Slack community and events like Fall Fest for online students provide unique networking opportunities. Moreover, its affordability and flexibility enable me to learn from anywhere in the world.

## Embracing the 'Turtle Pace'

I've adopted a deliberate pace through the program, taking just one course per semester. This approach is threefold:

1. It allows me to concentrate on developing tangible projects and products, reinforcing my belief in experiential learning. The hands-on experience enhances my grasp of theoretical concepts and fuels innovative ideas for class projects and products.
2. My employer provides educational resources, including Python data engineering and data science bootcamps, as well as access to DataCamp.com. These tools have been instrumental in honing skills like Git, Bash, SQL, Docker, and AWS cloud—essential for my progression to real-world projects and employment.
3. This measured pace ensures I can maintain my employment while advancing my education.

## Progress Report: My Academic Milestones

To date, I've completed three core courses:

- **Introduction to Software Development**: With my background in Python, this course's introduction to Python and Java programming was a comfortable fit. In hindsight, I might have considered testing out of this course.
- **Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science**: Although familiar with college-level calculus, this course's focus on discrete mathematics—covering topics like sets, functions, and graph theory—underscored the importance of these concepts in computer science.
- **Introduction to Computer Systems**: This course, which delved into C programming and machine language, challenged my understanding of computers. The highlight was constructing a rudimentary operating system, a task that tested my patience and deepened my knowledge of memory management.

With six core courses and four electives to graduation, my next steps are undecided. My elective choices will likely align with the projects I'm engaged in and the skills I aim to refine.
